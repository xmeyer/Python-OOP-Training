# Python-OOP-Training
First reason for doing these video tutorials is because I'm interested in making a new project where I can incorporate OOP with a machine learning project.
Second reason for doing these video tutorials is that it's been some months since I used object-oriented programming on a project, so I wanted to reintroduce some concepts and practices to myself. 
Lessons:
* Classes and Instances
* Class Variables
* classmethods and staticmethods
* Inheritance - Creating Subclasses
* Special (Magic/ Dunder) Methods
* Property Decorators - Getters, Setters, and Deleters
**From Corey Schafer's Python OOP Tutorial series**
